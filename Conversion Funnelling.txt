Conversion Funnelling

Initial Conversation	
Hi, how are you, where are you from, hobbies, etc - introductions must be made before we convert fans

This is just an easy normal conversation, the fans will generally be asking you questions, after all, its them who messaged you first. “Where are you from” etc, we can just respond back normally to these kind of questions.

Never Do These
Never sext
Never send photos
Never give away other contact platforms such as snapchat/telegram
Never give any kind of gratification “you’re my type”, “nice six pack”
Never waste your time in a conversation which becomes long and meaningless

Conversations Continued
After the opening conversation, the potential fan will then ask for pictures, meetups, etc 

Literally anything he asks for says can be redirected to onlyfans
Sexting - “I only discuss that kind of thing (sexual topics) on OF, btw its free”
Asking for pictures - “I don’t send pictures here, I only send them on OF”
Meetup Request - “I wouldnt really discuss anything like that here, only on OF”
Pretty much any request he makes will be redirected back to onlyfans

Conversations Continued 2
If someone sends a naked picture OR image you have to click on to unblur OR ANY PICTURE AT ALL

Simply say something such as “oh thats blurred for me, maybe my ISP is blocking it, you’ll have to send it on OF”

When Do Conversations End?		
Conversations end in 3 different scenarios and are generally very short

#1 - When you send the guy to onlyfans and he signs up - DO NOT MESSAGE HIM ANYMORE 
#2 - When the guy claims he has signed up, but actually hasn’t - DO NOT MESSAGE HIM ANYMORE
#3 - When he simply refuses to subscribe “oh i dont do onlyfans” - ok then, well thats the only place im comfortable talking - NO MORE TALKING

Link Structure & Messaging
Discord - easy mode
Discord is simple, we make them click the link in our bio which takes them to our private server/or onlyfans (we sometimes change this)

Reddit - hard mode
Reddit subs are better, but the messaging system only really works on aged accounts and the link needs to be broken (it cannot be direct)
You’ll need to come to my OF then, its *example* onlyfansdotcom/elphycosplay
